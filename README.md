# Marty Bop
A simple Spotify widget of a cat bopping his head to the tune of the song.

Follow the instructions given [here](https://github.com/p4nash/spotify-now-playing/blob/master/README.md).
The only difference is that the Redirect URI and url you use to access this has port no. 8888 instead of 8000.

Feel free to change the image of the kitty cat to something else!
